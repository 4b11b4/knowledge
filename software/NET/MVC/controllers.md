# Controllers
- A controller is responsible for controlling the way that a user interacts
  with an MVC application.
- Controllers contain flow control logic.
- Controllers determine what response to send back to a user after a request.
- A controller should contain the bare minimum of logic to return the right
  view or redirect the user to ano ther action (flow control). Everything else
  should be in the model.
- Controllers should only contain a few lines of code.
