# Microsoft REST API Guidelines
## Naming Conventions
### Types
- the type of the variable should be included when NOT including it would
  be ambiguous
- types MUST be at the end of the name, e.g. createdDateTime

### Compound Names
- avoid using names using articles such as 'a', 'the', 'of' unless necessary
  e.g. names such as `aUser` or `countOfBooks` should not be used and instead
  simply `user` or `bookCount`
